# Elastic-SIEM-Lab

**My Elastic SIEM Home Lab**

**Welcome to my Elastic SIEM home lab repository! I've documented the setup process and resources for creating an Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment. This lab uses the Elastic Web portal and a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM) to simulate security events, configure agents, query logs, visualize data, and set up alerts within Elastic SIEM.**

## **Prerequisites**

- Virtualization software such as VirtualBox or VMware
- Elastic account

## **Overview**

I've created this lab using Elastic Stack and a Kali Linux VM to:

- Collect security event logs with Elastic Agent
- Simulate security events with tools like Nmap
- Analyze and visualize data in Elastic SIEM
- Set up alerts for specific events
